Understanding the potential applications of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) in the Telecommunications industry to improve customer service and revenue, A Survey

## Introduction

This paper aims at understanding how generative adversarial networks can be applied in telecom industries for improving customer experience as well as increasing revenues. We first provide an overview of GANs with emphasis on their applications to the communication industry and discuss some potential use cases, such as automatic speech recognition (ASR), natural language processing tasks like sentiment analysis or text-to-speech conversion; image generation for content personalization in mobile networks; predicting user behavior based on historical data. We then explore various challenges faced by telecom operators when deploying GANs and propose potential solutions to overcome them, such as using federated learning techniques that allow distributed training of the models while protecting sensitive customer information. Finally we discuss some possible applications for improving customer service in terms of personalized recommendations or automating routine tasks like troubleshooting queries. We also consider revenue-generation opportunities related to GANs, such as advertisement and data monetization strategies that leverage the generated content from telecom operators' networks.
