       "The Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) is a deep learning approach for generating new training points that are close to the training data. The idea of GANs is to train two competing neural networks, a generator and a discriminator, and then train the generator to fool the discriminator, such that the discriminator cannot differentiate between data points taken from the real world and the fake data generated by the generator. This kind of training can be seen as an interesting alternative when more advanced techniques such as artificial neural networks do not work satisfactorily due to the distribution of the data points generated having a high variance and failing the so called “Kolmogorov-Smirnov Test” applied on generated data and real data. As a result, GANs are attracting attention in many industries and has been introduced in many domains including generating images and videos, in other words video games, speech synthesizers, virtual reality, finance, and healthcare. In this research, we review the different possible applications of GANs in the Telecommunications industry, and to see what might be the impact and to explore how they might be used to gain better insights into the customer behaviour in the industry. The survey of GANs that we conduct includes many examples of GANs where they have been used to enhance customer service and customer interaction with the telecommunications network. At the same time, we also include many examples of GANs where they have been used to help improve the quality of service and performance of the telecommunications network. We also introduce and discuss some of the different types of generative models that might have an impact on how GANs might be applied, including Variational Autoencoders and Generative Moment Matching Networks. Our focus is to identify GANs that have been deployed and to see how the technology might be improved and deployed to help create a more intelligent customer experience and increase revenue. Finally, we summarise some of the lessons learned from the deployed technology in this area in the telecommunications industry.\n",

       "Generative models, also known as generative models or generative models, have become popular in many industries including video games, Virtual Reality, healthcare, finance, and telecommunication [[START_REF] Machine learning: Trends, perspectives, and prospects, Jordan[END_REF], [START_REF] The History Began from AlexNet: A Comprehensive Survey on Deep Learning Approaches, Alom[END_REF], [START_REF] Understanding the potential of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) for evolving complex architectures, Foulds[END_REF]]. Generative models enable to create new training instances based on the existing data. In order to apply and train a generative models in any given industry, it is required to first perform exploratory data analysis by trying to understand the data in depth. It is then needed to understand the problem area that is being tackled, as well as to understand the real world that the data represents [[START_REF] Understanding the potential of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) for evolving complex architectures, Foulds[END_REF], [START_REF] Generative Adversarial Networks: An Overview, Creswell[END_REF]]. In some cases, it is also important to understand the different features on which the data is based before moving on to develop generative models. Once it has become clear that the generative model will play a key part in the solution, then it is necessary to identify when using a generative model is beneficial and when it is not beneficial [[START_REF] Machine learning: Trends, perspectives, and prospects, Jordan[END_REF]]. Some of the problems when applying machine learning techniques include how many data points are required in total to train the generative model and what is the distribution of data points that the model will train [[START_REF] Machine learning: Trends, perspectives, and prospects, Jordan[END_REF]]. In other words, the models are only good in problems where there are sufficient data points taken from multiple observations in multiple dimensions, meaning that the distribution of the data points are normally distributed. Unfortunately, most real world problems are not normally distributed and do not have a sufficient number of observed data points. To address this issue, Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) were introduced in 2014 by Generative Adversarial Networks. A GAN is an interesting neural network method of training a generative model and by using GANs, it has been suggested that generative models can be successfully applied in non-normal distributed problems [[START_REF] Generative Adversarial Nets, Goodfellow[END_REF]].\n",

       "Generative models have been successfully applied by several companies across different industries in problems that have non-normal distributions including the healthcare industry, the finance industry, Video games, and Virtual realities [[START_REF] GAN-Based Anomaly Detection on Sensor Data in Internet of Things, Yu[END_REF], [START_REF] Towards Robust and Scalable Images: A New Benchmark for Synthetic-to-Real Image Translation, Chen[END_REF], [START_REF] Generative Models for Financial Applications: a Review, Stoyanov[END_REF], [START_REF] Towards a realistic video game for virtual reality, Alsamhi[END_REF], [START_REF] Generative Adversarial Networks: An Overview, Creswell[END_REF]]. Generative models are useful for problems where it is not required to model the complete distribution of the data, but it is required that new training instances be created that have a close resemblance to the real data instances based on the features available. In this work, we focus on Generative Adversarial Neural Networks in particular, but we also consider other types of generative models that might be interesting to apply with the use of Generative Adversarial Networks. In this survey, we identify different possible applications of GANs in the telecommunications industry and to see if they might be able to help improve customer experience and customer interaction, as well as to help improve the quality of service and network performance in the telecommunications industry.\n",

       "Generative Adversarial Networks is a type of semi-supervised learning approach that enables new training instances to be created based on the real training data based on features and attributes that are available to the trained model [[START_REF] Generative Adversarial Nets, Goodfellow[END_REF], [START_REF] Generative Adversarial Networks: An Overview, Creswell[END_REF]]. In order to fully understand GANs, it is first necessary to first understand the concept of the original generative model, namely GANs that was introduced in 2014. An essential part of the original GANs was the objects that played a role in both the real world, and were represented by a real dataset. The objects were known as real instances; those that were based on the real training data. The real instances played the role of the data used in training conventional neural networks. The concept of real instances played the role of training a discriminator network. Secondly, the objects that were created by using the trained generative model were known as fake instances; those that were created and trained using information that was available to the trained model [[START_REF] Generative Adversarial Nets, Goodfellow[END_REF], [START_REF] Generative Adversarial Networks: An Overview, Creswell[END_REF]]. As a result, the real instances were known as real data and the fake instances were known as fake data. Thirdly, the trained discriminator network was known as the discriminator. The discriminator was trained to differentiate between the real instances (the real data) from the fake instances (the fake data). The discriminator was trained with the Metastatic Lung Adenocarcinoma (LUAD [[START_REF] Generative Adversarial Networks: An Overview, Creswell[END_REF]]) dataset that has a total of 5259 data points taken from 279 different patients. The discriminator was then able to differentiate between the real instances (LUAD dataset [[START_REF] Generative Adversarial Nets, Goodfellow[END_REF]]) and the fake instances (fake data data). An example of a trained discriminator is shown in Figure 1.\n",
       "\n",
       "On the other hand, the goal of the second network was to train a generative network, which was defined as the generator network, to generate a set of fake data points that were as close as possible to the training data. This objective was achieved when the discriminator was able to differentiate between the data points taken from the real dataset and the the fake data points created and trained on by the generator. The discriminator was therefore only able to differentiate between instances of training the discriminator that came from the real dataset (LUAD [[START_REF] Generative Adversarial Nets, Goodfellow[END_REF]]) from all instances coming from the generator that were generated [[START_REF] Understanding the potential of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) for evolving complex architectures, Foulds[END_REF]]. The generated data points were generated with a predefined distribution from the output of the generator. The generator was trained with feedback from the discriminator. This feedback was to train the generator such that it was able to pass feedback, or tell the discriminator that the distribution of fake data points was as close as possible to the real data points. The discriminator was trained with training data points that came from two different datasets, one dataset being data points that came from the real data and a second dataset being the fake data points generated by the generator. If the generator is unable to fool the discriminator, such that the data point that are the output from the generator and are being given to the discriminator is not rejected by the discriminator, then the generator is trained with the same loss function as the discriminator, but with the only difference being that the weights in the generator change.\n",

       "Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are a promising development that aims to improve on the quality of artificial data created by neural networks. GANs are capable of generating artificial data without having to first prepare a training data set to learn from. This has the potential to allow for the replacement of large sets of historical data with artificially generated data. This has the potential to improve customer service and reduce data leakage by limiting the number of existing data sets that are stored or even allowing the reuse of existing data sets without the requirement to disclose them. The paper presents the GAN architecture, and the types of data that can be generated. The applicability of GANs in the telecommunications industry is then discussed. It is shown that GANs could potentially increase the accuracy of AI algorithms and could greatly improve the quality of customer service. Revenue could potentially be increased by the same amount thanks to the ability to generate more data in less time.\n",

       "In recent years deep learning has seen a massive increase in popularity. Research shows that 40% of all machine-learning papers use one or more neural networks [[START_REF] A Survey on Deep Learning: Algorithms, Techniques, and Applications, Pouyanfar[END_REF]]. One of the main reasons for their success is that we can take existing methods and put them through one or an iterative process of retraining the networks to solve new problems. However, this comes at the cost of the need for large training data sets. In some areas large labelled training data sets may be outdated or expensive to collect. Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) allow the generation of artificial data without the process of requiring historical data to train on [[START_REF] Generative Adversarial Nets, Goodfellow[END_REF]] [[START_REF] Deepfool: A simple and accurate method to fool deep neural networks, Moosavi-Dezfooli[END_REF]].\n",
       "In this paper, the architectures and training methods of GANs are described. The potential uses of GANs are reviewed, including how these could further the telecommunications industry. By increasing the amount of data available to companies, the performance of the AI algorithms built around these data will greatly improve . Data leakage is a risk in this situation because companies will lose the ability to train the data to increase performance in the future. The reduction in data leakage will increase accountability of AI by allowing companies to show that they have been trained on sufficient data. By increasing data availability, the speed and accuracy of customer service will be improved. Ultimately, revenue could be increased by generating more data more quickly and reducing the data leakage risk.\n",

       "Generative Adversarial Networks are a type of generative model that was originally introduced by Ian Goodfellow at Google [[START_REF] Generative Adversarial Nets, Goodfellow[END_REF]]. Generative Adversarial Networks and the variants developed since are often referred to as GANs, although they may be more accurately described as “Generative Adversarial Frameworks” [[START_REF] BEGAN: Boundary Equilibrium Generative Adversarial Networks, Berthelot[END_REF]] [[START_REF] Adversarial Feature Learning, Donahue[END_REF]]. GANs consist of two models: a generator and a discriminator. The generator is an AI algorithm that uses input noise to generate artificial data. The discriminator is another AI algorithm that uses the real data to train on and the artificial data (from the generator) to test whether or not it comes from our domain distribution. The two AI algorithms are played off against each other. From an initial set of randomly generated data, each AI algorithm can improve its performance and its ability to generate more artificial data, thus improving the quality of the data generated by the generator. This continues until the GAN reaches a state where the generator is able to generate data to the extent that it is indistinguishable from the real data.\n",

       "Convolutional Generative Adversarial Networks (CGAN) are a variation of the original GAN where the generator and discriminator use convolutional neural networks [[START_REF] Recent Progress on Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs):ophagy, Yang[END_REF]]. Convolutional neural networks are popular AI algorithms and their usage has increased substantially in recent years [[START_REF] Recent Progress on Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs):ophagy, Yang[END_REF]]. A convolutionalocyal artificial neural network is able to generate feature maps (images) by combining feature maps and using convolutions between the feature maps. This is an advantage that convolutional neural networks (CNN) have over many other types of neural networks because they are able to generate large complex data without the need for millions of parameters to be optimised between each input layer and each generated layer [[START_REF] Recent Progress on Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs):ophagy, Yang[END_REF]]. An illustration of the typical structure of a CGAN is shown in figure 1. The CNN in the generator will output complex data in a sequence that must then be converted into images before it will be usable as a training input for the discriminator [[START_REF] Recent Progress on Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs):ophagy, Yang[END_REF]]. This structure reduces the number of parameters that is required to be optimised between every AI algorithm and the end result. It also increases the speed with which the GAN is able to generate data by making complex models less likely to need a large amount of training data to properly optimise AI algorithms [[START_REF] Recent Progress on Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs):ophagy, Yang[END_REF]]. The generator and the discriminator share the same layers to reduce the number of parameters that the AI algorithms can have to optimise and increase the complexity of the features that are generated.\n",
       "\n",
       "One of the difficulties with training GANs is that both AI algorithms have to be trained to the point where their loss functions are minimised. The generator must create data that is very similar to the data fed into the discriminator to ensure that only real data is selected by the discriminator. Otherwise, data that only gets accepted by the training algorithm will simply never be used to improve AI algorithms. This makes it very difficult to optimise the generator since a poor AI algorithm for the discriminator will prevent the generation of high-quality data from the generator. Conversely, a good AI algorithm for the discriminator can cause the generator to produce low-quality images that are very similar to the data already existing in training.\n",

       "In an ideal case with a basic GAN, the generator output will be compared to the input by a discriminator algorithm that can distinguish between the two. A loss function will indicate the performance of the generator and the discriminator. A loss of 0 means that the generator and discriminator will generate data that is completely indistinguishable from the original data so no action will need to be taken by a person analysing the outputs of the AI algorithms. The loss function for the generator should be negative since it will try and create better and better data that will be more and more similar to the real data. The loss function for the discriminator should be positive since the discriminator’s job is to distinguish the data (real vs artificial) and to not accept anything that is artificial.\n",
