For the sake of our argument, let’s also assume that every human being could create an application that learns from their own activity and improves based on it, with the purpose of being able to outperform them at something.\n",
       "If that were the case, the application would essentially create a “learning database” of a human and the process of learning from it would be similar to learning from the knowledge base (and its massive volume of data) that humans possess. \n",

       "Telecommunications is the science of transmitting information from one place to another. It has become a key part of our lives, and the demand for communication is increasing every day. In order to meet the ever-expanding demand, we are moving towards 5G networks, which are expected to have 1000 times the capacity of today's networks. This is achieved by increasing the number of base stations (BSs) and equipping them with more antennas. However, this comes at the cost of increased energy consumption, which is one of the biggest challenges in this field.\n",
       "\n",
       "One way to reduce the energy consumption is to use machine learning (ML) techniques, such as deep learning (DL), to predict the load on the BSs. This can be done by training the DL model on data that has been collected over a period of time, and then using the trained model to predict the load in the future. The predictions can then be used to adjust the power consumption of the BSs, which in turn reduces the energy consumption.\n",
       "\n",
       "This approach has been shown to be effective in [START_REF] Deep Learning in Mobile and Wireless Networking: A Survey, Zhang[END_REF] and [2]. In the following, we will give a high-level overview of this approach.\n",
