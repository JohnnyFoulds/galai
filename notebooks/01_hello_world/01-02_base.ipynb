       "\n",
       "Deep learning is a branch of machine learning which has been shown to outperform other machine learning algorithms. It is a sub-field of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and a sub-field of Machine Learning (ML). The concept of Deep Learning (DL) was introduced by LeCun et al. in 1989 [[START_REF] Deep Learning, Schulz[END_REF]]. DL is a subset of ML which uses Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs). The ANN is a computer-based machine designed to imitate the brain’s structure and functions. An ANN is a network of artificial neurons which are the basic elements of an ANN. A neuron consists of three main components: 1) a set of weighted input connections, 2) an activation function, and 3) a set of output connections.\n",
       "\n",
       "The neurons work together to form a single network and perform tasks such as classification, prediction, and pattern recognition. The ANN is trained using a large amount of data and the weights of the network are adjusted based on the training data. The training process is called learning and it is a process where the weights are updated based on the error rate between the actual output and the expected output. The error is calculated by comparing the actual output and the expected output using a loss function. In this paper, we review the recent developments in the use of DL in the Telecommunications industry.\n",
       "\n",
       "The Telecommunications industry has been one of the fastest growing industries in the world. The telecommunications industry is a global industry which is highly dependent on the usage of AI. The telecommunications industry is also one of the fastest growing industries in the world. According to the Global Telecommunications Survey 2018, there were more than 450 million connected users in 2017, and this figure is expected to grow to 524 million connected users in 2021 [[START_REF] Global telecommunications survey 2018, Blyth[END_REF]]. In the telecommunications industry, AI has been used for different purposes such as:\n",
       "\n",
       "1. Automatic switching [[START_REF] Automatic switching for next generation mobile networks: a survey, Zhang[END_REF]]: Automatic switching refers to the process of deciding which network should be used for a call based on the current network state and the information provided by the user. For example, the user may want to switch to a different network in case of an emergency, or to switch to a network which is less congested or with better coverage.\n",
       "2. Traffic control [[START_REF] Intelligent Traffic Control for 5G Networks, Al-Dulaimi[END_REF]]: This is the process of deciding which networks to open and which networks to close based on the traffic demand and the available capacity of the networks.\n",
       "3. Content delivery [[START_REF] A survey on 5G Content Delivery Networks, Sharma[END_REF]]: This is the process of deciding which content to deliver to the end-user based on the current network state and the content availability.\n",
       "4. Service management [[START_REF] 5G Service Management: A Survey, Awais[END_REF]]: This is the process of managing the services in a network to ensure that they are delivered to the users with high quality.\n",

       "Abstract: The time-to-penis (TTP) principle is a key element in the sperm selection process. The sperm selection process is based on the TTP principle, which states that spermatozoa that have already reached the female reproductive tract will reach the egg more rapidly than spermatozoa that have not yet reached the female reproductive tract. The TTP principle is the basis for many sperm selection techniques, such as timed insemination (TI), timed AI (TAI) and timed insemination-embryo transfer (TIET). The TTP principle has been investigated by several authors and is now well understood. However, the molecular mechanisms involved in the TTP principle remain largely unknown. In this review, we provide a summary of the TTP principle, with emphasis on its molecular mechanisms. We discuss recent findings from animal and human studies that indicate the involvement of molecules that are important for sperm function and fertilization, such as those involved in the regulation of the acrosome reaction, DNA damage repair, sperm motility, and apoptosis. We also review the role of microRNAs in the TTP principle.\n",

       "In the last decade, the Internet of Things (IoT) has emerged as a major paradigm for the Internet, in which billions of devices connected to the Internet have an increased sensing capability and act as the source of data for applications and services. IoT is expected to have a major impact on our daily lives, by providing an intelligent and personalized environment [[START_REF] Internet of Things (IoT): A vision, architectural elements, and future directions, Gubbi[END_REF]]. The number of connected devices is expected to reach 50 billion by 2020 [[START_REF] Internet of Things (IoT): A vision, architectural elements, and future directions, Gubbi[END_REF]], and it is expected that the number of connected devices will increase exponentially [[START_REF] Internet of Things (IoT): A vision, architectural elements, and future directions, Gubbi[END_REF]]. This exponential increase of connected devices will cause a rapid increase in the number of data generated by these devices. This is because the data generated by IoT devices is usually in the form of text, image, audio, video, and sensor data [[START_REF] Internet of Things (IoT): A vision, architectural elements, and future directions, Gubbi[END_REF]].\n",
       "\n",
       "IoT applications are designed to be used in a variety of environments. This requires that IoT applications should be able to adapt to the characteristics of the environment, such as the network topology and available resources. IoT applications should also be able to provide context-awareness, i.e., the ability to understand and adapt to the user's context, in order to enable personalized services. In addition, IoT applications should provide security to the IoT devices.\n",
       "\n",
       "There are two approaches to designing context-aware IoT applications. One approach is to develop applications that use the same model for the context and the applications themselves [[START_REF] Context Aware Computing for The Internet of Things: A Survey, Perera[END_REF]]. This approach is useful for developing applications that need to perform specific tasks in specific environments, such as healthcare applications. The other approach is to develop applications that use a context model to specify the context and the applications themselves. In this approach, the context model can be developed using an ontology-based context model, which is a semantic context model [[START_REF] Context Aware Computing for The Internet of Things: A Survey, Perera[END_REF]]. The ontology-based context model is an ontology, which describes the context using terms from the domain ontology [[START_REF] Context Aware Computing for The Internet of Things: A Survey, Perera[END_REF]]. This approach is useful for developing context-aware applications that require an understanding of the context of the environment.\n",
       "\n",
       "The IoT applications can be designed using the ontology-based context model. However, the development of an ontology-based context model requires a substantial amount of time and effort. In addition, the ontology-based context model can only be used for developing context-aware applications that are designed to be used in a specific environment. In order to develop IoT applications that are context-aware and can be used in a variety of environments, it is necessary to develop an ontology-based context model that can be used for designing and developing IoT applications that are context-aware and can be used in a variety of environments.\n",
       "\n",
       "In this paper, we propose an ontology-based context model that can be used for designing and developing context-aware IoT applications that can be used in a variety of environments. The proposed model can be used to describe the context of the environment and the applications themselves. The proposed model consists of the following three elements: (1) a context model, (2) a context ontology, and (3) an application ontology. The context model describes the environment using terms from the context ontology. The context ontology is an ontology that describes the context using terms from the domain ontology. The application ontology describes the applications using terms from the application ontology.\n",
       "\n",
       "The contributions of this paper are as follows. (1) We propose an ontology-based context model that can be used for designing and developing context-aware IoT applications that can be used in a variety of environments. (2) We propose a context ontology and an application ontology that describe the context and the applications, respectively. (3) We propose a context model that describes the environment using terms from the context ontology.\n",
       "\n",
       "The rest of this paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we review related works. In Section 3, we introduce the context model and the application model. In Section 4, we present the implementation of the proposed model. In Section 5, we evaluate the proposed model. In Section 6, we present the conclusions and future work.\n",

       "An ontology is a formal and explicit specification of a shared conceptualization [[START_REF] Ontology Development 101: A Guide to Creating Your First Ontology, Noy[END_REF]]. In the IoT domain, ontologies have been used for describing the IoT devices and the applications. For example, the IoT Ontology (IoT-O) [[START_REF] An Ontology for Internet of Things, Biplav[END_REF]] and the Semantic Sensor Network Ontology (SSN-O) [[START_REF] Semantic Sensor Network Ontology (SSN-O): An Ontology for the Semantic Web in the Internet of Things, Benslimane[END_REF]] are ontologies that describe the IoT devices and the applications, respectively.

       "\n",
       "In this section, we review the literature on the topic of text classification and sentiment analysis.\n",
       "\n",
       "# 3.1. Text Classification\n",
       "\n",
       "Text classification is the task of assigning a text into one or more predefined classes.\n",
       "\n",
       "A common approach for text classification is to transform the text into a vector of feature vectors. A vector representation of a document is often constructed using a set of features extracted from the document (or text). The features can be words, phrases, or terms. A variety of features and classification techniques have been used for text classification.\n",
       "\n",
       "The features used in text classification are generally domain-dependent. A set of terms are extracted from the document and the feature vector is constructed using the term frequencies and the term positions in the document. The term frequencies are usually the numbers of times a term occurs in the document. The term positions are usually the positions of the term in the document. The term positions are often used to determine the relative importance of the term. For example, the term position at the beginning of a document is more important than the term position at the end of a document.\n",
       "\n",
       "The most commonly used classification technique for text classification is the k-nearest neighbors (k-NN) classifier [START_REF] Text Categorization with Support Vector Machines: Learning with Many Relevant Features, Joachims[END_REF]. The k-NN classifier is a simple and effective classifier. It can be applied to any classification problem and it has been used in many text classification problems.\n",
       "\n",
       "# 3.2. Sentiment Analysis\n",
       "\n",
       "Sentiment analysis is the process of determining the sentiment (positive or negative) of a given text. Sentiment analysis is one of the most challenging tasks in natural language processing. Sentiment analysis has been applied to a variety of domains such as customer reviews, customer-to-customer interactions, opinion mining, opinion mining on the Internet, and opinion mining on social media.\n",
       "\n",
       "Sentiment analysis can be used to determine the quality of a product, the reputation of a company, and the sentiment of a customer. For example, a review of a hotel website could provide valuable information about the hotel, the service it offers, and the experience of the user. The review can also provide information about the customer and their experience.\n",
       "\n",
       "Sentiment analysis has many applications in business. For example, if a company needs to improve the service it provides, they can look at customer reviews and see if the customers have positive or negative opinions about the service.\n",
       "\n",
       "In addition, sentiment analysis can be used to detect and mitigate the negative effects of social media. For example, if a company finds that many customers are expressing negative opinions about their company, they can look at the reviews of other companies and see if there are similar negative reviews. If a company finds that a similar company has similar negative reviews, they can investigate the reason behind this and make changes.\n",
       "\n",
       "Sentiment analysis is also used to determine the opinions of individuals on a given topic. For example, the opinions of students on a given topic can be analyzed to determine if the students are satisfied with the learning material or if they are dissatisfied with the learning material.\n",
