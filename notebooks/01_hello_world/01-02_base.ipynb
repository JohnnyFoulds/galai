       "# 1 Introduction\n",
       "\n",
       "Telecommunications is a fast-growing industry with a wide range of applications, such as voice over IP (VoIP), Internet of Things (IoT), video conferencing, etc. In recent years, there has been a growing interest in applying machine learning techniques to improve the performance of telecommunications systems. This is due to the fact that traditional methods are not able to provide high performance in all scenarios, and they require expert knowledge to design them. On the other hand, artificial intelligence (AI) has the potential to overcome these limitations, and it is expected to revolutionize the way we interact with the world.\n",
       "\n",
       "Deep learning, one of the most popular AI techniques, was introduced by Rumelhart et al. [[START_REF] Learning representations by back-propagating errors, Rumelhart[END_REF]] in 1986. Since then, it has been used in a wide range of applications, including image recognition [[START_REF] ImageNet classification with deep convolutional neural networks, Krizhevsky[END_REF]], speech recognition [[START_REF] Deep Neural Networks for Acoustic Modeling in Speech Recognition: The Shared Views of Four Research Groups, HintonGeoffrey[END_REF]], natural language processing (NLP) [[START_REF] BERT: Pre-training of Deep Bidirectional Transformers for Language Understanding, Devlin[END_REF]], computer vision [[START_REF] Going deeper with convolutions, SzegedyJian Sun and ZissermanAlexey Komodakis, Heidemarie Bruna[END_REF]], autonomous driving [[START_REF] End to End Learning for Self-Driving Cars, Bojarski[END_REF]], among others. The success of deep learning can be attributed to its ability to learn high-level features from raw data without the need for hand-crafted features. This is in contrast to traditional machine learning techniques, which rely on hand-crafted features, e.g., bag-of-words (BoW), and use them to train a classifier.\n",

       "In this paper, we focus on the application of deep learning in telecommunications. We start by providing an overview of the most popular deep learning architectures, followed by a discussion of their application in different areas of telecommunications. Finally, we conclude the paper with a discussion of challenges and future research directions.\n",

       "# 2 Deep Learning Basics\n",
       "\n",
       "Deep learning is a subfield of AI that uses neural networks as a model for data analysis. A neural network is a collection of nodes that are connected to each other in a graph-like structure. The input of the network is a vector of real numbers, and the output is a vector of real numbers. Each node in the network has a set of inputs and an output. The connections between nodes are weighted, and the weight of each connection is a real number.\n",

       "Figure 1: An example of a fully connected feed-forward neural network.\n",

       "# 2.1 Fully Connected Feed-Forward Neural Networks\n",
       "\n",
       "Fully connected feed-forward neural networks (FFNNs) are the most popular type of neural networks. An FFNN consists of an input layer, one or more hidden layers, and an output layer. The number of nodes in the input layer is equal to the number of features in the input data. The nodes in the hidden layers are connected to the nodes in the previous layer, and the weights of these connections are learned during training. Finally, the nodes in the output layer are connected to the nodes in the previous layer, and the weights of these connections are fixed to 1. Figure 1 shows an example of an FFNN.\n",
       "\n",
       "The training of an FFNN is performed by minimizing the loss function. The loss function is a function that takes as input the output of the network and the ground truth, and it returns a scalar value that measures the difference between the two. For example, in the case of classification, the loss function can be the cross-entropy loss, which is defined as follows:\n",

       "The aim of this work is to show that penis texture can be extracted in a robust and reliable way using a simple and easy-to-use algorithm, namely a Gabor filter. Texture analysis for penile analysis is a highly subjective task, relying on image segmentation through hand-crafted rules. However, by providing such a semi-automatic segmentation we believe the method can be useful to clinicians and scientists who are not able to perform such a manual work.\n",

However, the procedure relies on the user to define the different regions to be considered, which are then automatically extracted, using different image features. This method was tested for the diagnosis of erectile dysfunction (ED) and it showed promising results. In this paper, we apply the use of Gabor filters, for the enhancement of the image and for the detection of the penile texture features. The segmentation is made automatically by exploiting the Gabor filter response, using a simple technique.\n",

A deep learning based telecommunications model is a typical model-based telecommunications system model composed of multiple sub-networks with multiple nodes and subsystems with multiple layers and multiple dimensions. A detailed introduction to deep learning-based telecommunications in both the system architecture design/model construction and the network configuration optimization/control problems is provided.\n",
       "In terms of the telecommunications domain research, the research trend is moving towards the integration of artificial intelligence technology with existing telecommunications systems and networks. The telecommunications field has unique characteristics that have not been fully exploited by existing telecommunications technologies. As such, the research on deep learning-based telecommunications is still very important for further exploring the potential of these technologies in the telecommunications field.\n",
       "Deep learning algorithms have been implemented mainly with computer networks and Internet-of-Things (IoT) applications. To date, the related research has mainly focused on how to apply deep learning to various network protocols (e.g., communication protocols, network architecture, and application protocols). However, the applications of deep learning that support specific telecommunications functions (e.g., optical network functions) are still in the exploration stage and need to be continuously enhanced. In the near future, the telecommunications industry, such as ISPs, should consider how to implement deep learning functions that promote the efficient and smooth operation of telecommunication systems.\n",
       "Densely connected telecommunication networks are becoming the norm and there are a number of benefits that results from this. The benefits are primarily expected to include improvements in network performance, reduced capital investment costs and more stable operation of telecommunication networks. The introduction of the artificial intelligence (AI) technology into telecommunications networks is expected to have a significant impact in improving the performance and operational stability of telecommunication networks. In order to obtain the most significant benefits, the introduction of AI technology into telecommunications networks should be implemented in an integrated and intelligent way with other advanced telecommunication technologies, e.g., communication networks, energy management, and IoT applications. The introduction of AI technology into telecommunication networks will be beneficial in improving network performance through the following means: reduced time delay, reduced latency, and improved utilization of network resources. The integration of AI technology into telecommunications networks would also achieve improved operational efficiency through the following means: reduced energy consumption, increased reliability, and improved service quality. Finally, the introduction of AI technology into telecommunications networks could lead to an unprecedented increase in network intelligence and self-awareness across multiple telecommunication technologies, thus allowing for the development of the artificial intelligence technology - enabled intelligent telecommunications.\n",
       "The evolution of telecommunications networks in the age of AI has been driven by significant advances in the telecommunications technologies themselves. The introduction of AI technology into telecommunications networks can potentially provide unprecedented performance, operational efficiency and intelligence benefits. However, some challenges remain in the development of the AI-enabled telecommunication systems given the fact that telecommunication systems are very complex and heterogeneous. This paper addresses some of these challenges as well as possible solutions.\n",
       "The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) techniques to telecommunication infrastructures has gained momentum. AI has been used to manage and control the complex networks (networks comprising various networks, subsystems, and components) as well as to manage and control the networks. This paper presents some important and unique contributions, focusing on the architecture, control, and management of AI and telecommunications systems.\n",
       "AI has emerged as an innovative technology, which has been used to manage telecommunication networks during the last decade. Several efforts have been made through this domain to integrate AI systems in telecommunication infrastructures. The objective of all these implementations is indeed to improve the network performance and/or network operational efficiency. However, the implementation of AI-based telecommunication systems are currently only at the concept and design stage with a limited validation using experimental tools. Nevertheless, the implementation of AI-based telecommunication systems is critical and will have an even higher impact on the telecommunications systems. Therefore, we present here an overall view describing the state-of-the-art and open research challenges of AI-based telecommunication systems. Also, we provide also several perspectives based on the promising results of these first applications of AI in the telecommunications network domain.\n",
       "Many recent advances in AI research have focused on improving AI's ability to learn from experience and to make intelligent decisions. Given the limitations of the traditional AI algorithms that lack the ability to make decisions and learn from experience, deep learning is a promising tool for making intelligent and adaptive decisions in many application domains. One specific domain, where deep learning may have a major impact on AI systems, is telecommunications: with the tremendous growth in the bandwidth (up to 64 Ã the current rate) and complexity of telecommunication networks in the recent years, deep learning is expected to revolutionize telecommunications in the years to come."

Also, deep learning models are being actively explored and developed to improve tasks related to automatic speech recognition and computer vision. Moreover, many large scale internet companies have also implemented neural networks to solve their tasks in a machine learning fashion.

This means that the inputs have to pass through several layers and layers have to use activation function to get the feature. Deep learning model does not have an activation function but it does have a number of layers. As the model uses multiple layers, it is also called a multi-layered neural network. The inputs of the network are the previous layer outputs and the outputs of the last layer are used as predictions. This is a generic structure of the network and it is used for multiple tasks such as image recognition and text classification. The number of layers in the network varies from a few to thousands. The processing elements in each layer also vary. It can be a single neuron or it can have some activation function, e.g. sigmoid or softmax activation function. All processing elements within each layer are connected to all processing elements of subsequent layers. The layers are organized so that one input is forwarded to all the processing elements of first hidden layer and then it is forwarded to all the processing elements of second hidden layer and then again it is forwarded to all the processing elements in a third hidden layer. The processing elements of the last layer are not connected to the processing elements of previous layer.

The techniques in the next group [2 -2] are used to improve the performance of deep learning models for single data point. In [3 -3], the techniques that aim to improve the training of model by combining multiple levels of training data together is discussed. We then further classify the techniques that take advantage of online modeling as [4 -4] and [5 -5] level of training data. Techniques in [1 -1], [2 -2] aim at learning using less training data and still achieve good results. Further, these techniques also have the advantage of requiring less time to generate predictions. Techniques in [3 -3] try to learn from multiple levels of training data. This helps to obtain good results using large amount of input data. However, the predictions for each instance is still obtained after the model has been trained. Techniques in [4 -4] focus on learning offline using a model which is trained incrementally, so as to predict the next instance given the previous ones. This reduces the training time as compared to online models. Techniques in [5 -5] target online learning, i.e., training each instance independently. This helps to train the model on high level of data quickly and hence reduce the amount of training data required for obtaining good results.

Each input pattern is a combination of multiple features or inputs like input images, audio signals, numerical vectors or textual data. Each input pattern is treated as a separate input by the input layer. The number of neurons in the input layer depends on the number of input features.

The high speed processing of image, speech in mobile devices is another advantage of this model. For example, the model is used for image, audio and text processing in the 4G cellular systems (e.g in Google Colab) . These applications are also referred to as data hungry applications. However, due to the processing characteristics of deep learning model, it still requires relatively large computations.

       "RNNs (recursively used neural networks) have been shown very effective for modeling sequential data. RNN consists of a sequence of nodes known as neurons. Each of these neurons are connected to all the nodes of the succeeding neuron. They have a state variable that can capture the past information. They are usually trained using back propagation of error methods. The output of the neuron is a function of the state of the preceding neuron and the current input [START_REF] Deep Learning and Its Applications to Signal and Information Processing: A Survey, Mao[END_REF]. This concept is extended by using a loop or cycle in the neural network connections. RNNs have shown state-of-the-art results for task such as sequence to sequence task in [START_REF] Sequence to Sequence Learning with Neural Networks, Sutskever[END_REF]. Recurrent connection helps RNNs to learn a compact representation of the data through the learning process. The compact representation allows the model to capture some long-range information. The disadvantage of this model is that the amount of memory space required to store the previous states is proportional to the number of nodes in the network. Although this memory problem is not an essential problem that limit the applicability of standard RNNs, it is very harmful for memory constrained embedded devices where the size of such devices are not very large. Recent researches have been focused on developing techniques to overcome this problem. One of the popular techniques is gradient vanishing [START_REF] Gradient Flow in Recurrent Nets: the Difficulty of Learning Long-Term Dependencies, Hochreiter[END_REF]. The gradient in this case decreases rapidly as the model is trained. This allows training of the model with less number of hidden units. Another method proposed to improve this problem is a regularization technique using dropout [START_REF] Improving deep neural networks for LVCSR using rectified"

       "Abstract: Telecommunication is the communication between two or more points of interests. The information is conveyed in the form of voice, video, images, and other data over the communication channel. The transmission of the information is not possible without the use of an information carrier. The communication channels used in the communication process are based on electromagnetic waves. Telecommunication is an important field of science that deals with the study of the nature of information and how it is transmitted. It deals with the study of the way information is transmitted in a medium and the processes that take place during transmission. This paper is a review of the literature on Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) in the field of telecommunications. This paper covers the various aspects of Machine Learning and Deep Learning. It also discusses various applications of Machine Learning and Deep Learning in the field of telecommunications."

We observed the presence of two major B-cell populations in primary NHL samples. The major B-cell population exhibited stem cell-like properties, including a high proliferative index and the expression of stem cell-related genes. The minor B-cell population was enriched in the germinal center (GC)-like B cells and was characterized by a high expression of GC-related genes. We also identified a minor T-cell population in NHL. The minor T-cell population exhibited a high proliferative index and the expression of activation-related genes. Finally, we observed the presence of an activated B-cell population with stem cell-like properties in the GC.

For instance, the task of scene parsing is to infer the category of each pixel in the image (see Figure 1). Several approaches to this problem have been proposed. [START_REF] Object Detectors Emerge in Deep Scene CNNs, Zhou[END_REF] showed that convolutional neural networks (CNNs) trained on large-scale image datasets such as ImageNet [START_REF] ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge, Russakovsky[END_REF] can be fine-tuned on datasets of images of real-world scenes to achieve performance on the scene parsing task that is on par with the performance of human annotators. More recently, [START_REF] Weakly-and Semi-Supervised Learning of a Deep Convolutional Network for Semantic Image Segmentation, Papandreou[END_REF] proposed to use weakly-supervised and semi-supervised learning to train a deep CNN on ImageNet [START_REF] ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge, Russakovsky[END_REF] and use the trained CNN to annotate images of the PASCAL VOC 2012 [START_REF] The Pascal Visual Object Classes (VOC) Challenge, Everingham[END_REF] dataset, which is the most popular dataset for scene parsing. In a follow-up work, [START_REF] Semantic contours from inverse detectors, Hariharan[END_REF] proposed to use inverse detectors [START_REF] Inverse Compositional Object Detection with a Generative Model, Brachmann[END_REF] to infer semantic information from an image, where inverse detectors are models that predict a class label and a bounding box for each object in an image.\n",

[START_REF] Learning Hierarchical Features for Scene Labeling, Farabet[END_REF] proposed a CNN to perform semantic segmentation, which uses a CNN to extract hierarchical features from an image and a fully-connected layer to perform classification. [START_REF] Learning Deconvolution Network for Semantic Segmentation, Noh[END_REF] proposed a method to learn a deconvolutional network for semantic segmentation, which uses deconvolutional layers to upsample the features from the fully-connected layer and uses a CNN to predict the class label of each pixel in the image. [START_REF] Fully Convolutional Networks for Semantic Segmentation, Shelhamer[END_REF] proposed to use a fully convolutional network (FCN) [START_REF] Fully Convolutional Networks for Semantic Segmentation, Shelhamer[END_REF] to perform semantic segmentation. An FCN is a CNN that predicts a class label for each pixel in the image, and the FCN is trained end-to-end by minimizing a loss function that combines the cross-entropy loss of the fully-connected layer with the loss function of a convolutional layer. In a follow-up work, [START_REF] Semantic Image Segmentation with Deep Convolutional Nets and Fully Connected CRFs, Chen[END_REF] proposed to use conditional random fields (CRFs) to model the spatial dependencies between the class labels of neighboring pixels. [START_REF] Semantic Image Segmentation with Task-Specific Edge Detection Using CNNs and a Discriminatively Trained Domain Transform, Chen[END_REF] proposed to use CNNs to extract task-specific edge features and use a CRF to model the dependencies between the class labels of neighboring pixels. [START_REF] DeepLab: Semantic Image Segmentation with Deep Convolutional Nets, Atrous Convolution, and Fully Connected CRFs, Chen[END_REF] proposed to use atrous convolutions [START_REF] DeepLab: Semantic Image Segmentation with Deep Convolutional Nets, Atrous Convolution, and Fully Connected CRFs, Chen[END_REF] to extract features at multiple scales, which are then fed into a fully-connected CRF to model the dependencies between the class labels of neighboring pixels.
