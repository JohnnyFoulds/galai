The research content of the paper is summarized as follows:\\n\\n1. In the current network environment, the number of wireless communication devices is increasing year by year, which is the key to solving the problem of network resource consumption. At the same time, the development of wireless communication technology is also accelerating, which makes it difficult for wireless communication equipment to meet the needs of communication users. Therefore, how to effectively improve the utilization rate of wireless communication resources is an urgent problem to be solved. 2. Due to the huge amount of data in the wireless communication environment, the existing network is facing the problem of big data. How to effectively use the data to help improve the quality of service and reduce the cost of communication has become a problem that must be solved. 3. At present, the most popular deep learning algorithms are the CNN and RNN. The paper compares and analyzes the advantages and disadvantages of the two algorithms, and the advantages and disadvantages of these two algorithms are summarized.\\n\\n# 2. RELATED WORK\\n\\nIn the era of big data, the amount of data is increasing exponentially, and the data analysis is facing a new challenge. At present, most of the data analysis algorithms use traditional methods to extract useful information from the data, and the algorithms based on traditional machine learning are usually used to identify the relationship between data samples. In recent years, the deep learning algorithm has been widely used in many fields.\\n\\n# 2.1. CNN\\n\\nThe CNN is a deep learning algorithm proposed by the University of Leicester in 2012. The CNN can extract more abstract features of the data by stacking several layers of convolution operations, and the data obtained by stacking several layers of convolution operations can also be used as the input of the next layer of convolution operations. Therefore, the CNN can not only extract more abstract features of the data but also obtain a high-level feature expression of the data. At present, the CNN has been widely used in many fields, such as speech recognition, image recognition, natural language processing, and so on.\\n\\n# 2.1.1. CNN Structure\\n\\nThe CNN structure is shown in Fig. 1.\\n\\nThe structure of the CNN is shown in Fig. 1.\\n\\nIn Fig. 1, the input layer of the CNN is the data to be analyzed, and the number of neurons in the input layer is the same as the number of data samples. In the convolution layer, the number of neurons in the convolution layer is equal to the number of neurons in the input layer, and the convolution operation is performed on the input data, which can be expressed as:\\n\\n( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ('"
